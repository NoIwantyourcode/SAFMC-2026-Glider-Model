#Ultra Important note to reviewers
This is a not a competition that is affiliated with my school, I have joined the competion myself as it aligns with my interests and passion and it is my sole decision to do so

#Why I am doing this project
This a project dedicated to maing the best possible glider for a competitiion that is held sometime midmarch, my goal is to not only win, But to dominate

I already did this competion last year once, I am applying everthing that I learn't from last year not only including where I went wrong but also where I went right

#Design specification
My glider has a list of specifications that it must meet to qualify and achieve these goals
     - The gliders maximum wing span and fuselage length must be 60cm
     - the gliders minimum wing span and fuselage length must be 30cm
     - The glider cannot weigh over 250grams
     - It must incorporate a 20mm diameter hook for launch
     - The glider must be durable and able to handle immeadiate and harsh acceleration within a short distance
     - The glider must fly a minimum of 36 meters however the more the better
     - The glider must not deviate too while in flight as there is no method to control it once launched

#Designs
Currently I have 2 possible final design with more to come and 18 possible preliminary design
Out of 18 possible preliminary design I will chose 3 to upgrade and reform into possible final design

Images of my preliminary design will be in a seperate folder, There will be no step files of the preliminary designs as most of then will not be made in real life, The designs I do make in real life will have step files included with those being 'possible final design files'

I have also added the competition challenge and rule booklet for the reviewers to look at
